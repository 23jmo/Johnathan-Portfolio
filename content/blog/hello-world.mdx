# Hello, World

This is my first blog post. I've been writing for a while now, mostly in the form of journal entires. But I'm deciding I want to post writing online, so I'm starting here.
  
## Why write?

I think writing is one of the best ways to clarify your thinking. When you try to explain something in words, you quickly find out what you actually understand and what you don't. I also have a lot of opinions on life, productivity, goal-setting, and meaning, so I'm gonna make u guys read it lol.

A little more about me that probably wasn't immediately obvious on the homepage:
- I'm 20
- Grew up in the Bay Area, went to Umich for a year then transferred to Columbia
- Always been a creative, from doodling to video editing / 3d modeling to vlogs
- in a relationship with gf for a year now 
- obsessed with self-improvement and productivity

## What I'll write about (roughly)

- **Productivity and Fulfillment** — my thoughts on productivity, goal-setting, and meaning
- **CS and engineering** — projects I'm working on, things I'm learning, takes on the future of AI
- **Philosophy** - my personal philosophies when it comes to relationships, happiness, and being alive

Stay tuned for more.
