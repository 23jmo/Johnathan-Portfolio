# Hello, World

This is my first blog post. I've been meaning to start writing for a while now, and I'm finally getting around to it.

## Why write?

I think writing is one of the best ways to clarify your thinking. When you try to explain something in words, you quickly find out what you actually understand and what you don't.

## What I'll write about

- **CS and engineering** — projects I'm working on, things I'm learning
- **Research** — notes from my work in computer graphics, AR/VR, and ML
- **College life** — transferring from Michigan to Columbia, navigating CS programs

Stay tuned for more.
